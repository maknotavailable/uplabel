    "# Introduction to UpLabel\n",
    "\n",
    "UpLabel is a lightweight, Python-based and modular tool which serves to support your machine learning tasks by making the data labeling process more efficient and structured. UpLabel is presented and tested within the MLADS-Session *\"Distributed and Automated Data Labeling using Active Learning: Insights from the Field\"*.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Session Description\n",
    "High-quality training data is essential for succeeding at any supervised machine learning task. There are numerous open source tools that allow for a structured approach to labeling. Instead of randomly choosing labeling data, we make use of machine learning itself for continuously improving the training data quality. Based on the expertise of the labelers as well as the complexity of the data, labeling tasks can be distrubuted in an intelligent way. Based on a real-world example from one of our customers, we will show how to apply the latest technology to optimize the task of labeling data for NLP problems.  \n",
